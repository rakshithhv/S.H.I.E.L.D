A TrackMe System to help and monitor a patient with Alzheimer’s disease and also this can be extended to people who forget things often.

A TrackMe Bag contains all the important things which the patient needs.

The Patient can press a Push button(Radio Frequency) which is provided when  he/she forgets any of the things. 

The push button sends the message to the Radio Frequency Transmitter which is connected to an ESP(wifi module) which sends the Status of the button to Samsung Artik Cloud.

The Artik Cloud forwards this status to another ESP which is connected to a Radio Frequency Receiver and a Buzzer. Due to the buzzer sound emitted, the patient can track the Bag and stop the Buzzer.

The series of events is kept track by sending emails from the artik cloud to the Guardian of the patient by noting down the status of each devices.
